Build a responsive “Certificates” section for my personal portfolio website.  
Display each certificate as a clean, minimal card (no buttons like “View,” “Download,” or “Verify”).  
Each card should include:
- Certificate title
- Issuer / Organization
- Recipient name (“Viisnu Anand S”)
- Date or period
- Short one-line description or key detail
- Optional small metadata badges (like “Course,” “Internship,” or “Score: 73”)
Use a modern card layout (rounded corners, subtle shadows, equal width cards in a responsive grid: 3 per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile).
